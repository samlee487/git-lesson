#Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of version control.

This is part of the first lesson of CHEM 280.

To make a commit(or "version" or "checkpoint") of your project, follow this procedure:

1. Make Changes to your project that you would like to keep.
2. When you have your changes, tell git you are ready to create a checkpoint of the files by using `git add` command and list the files
3. Create a checkpoint using `git commit -m "message about what you did"`
